# Kattis Problems

This repository holds my solutions to the various problems on Kattis.

## Folder Structure

When adding a new solution to the project:

- Make a separate directory for that problem
- Make separate subdirectories for solutions in different languages
- Sample inputs should be in files named `sample-input-x`, where `x` is the sample number.
- Expected outputs should go in a `README.md` file - use the following as a template:

```markdown
# [Problem Name] - Expected Outputs

## Sample 1

窶義``
some output
窶義``

## Sample 2

窶義``
more output
窶義``
```
